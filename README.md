# Panda-challenge
# PyCitySchools

A dive into using Pandas to analyze data, this project helps a fictional school district make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities by analyzing a district-wide data set. 

The first aspect of the project analyzes district-wide standardized test results, aggregating data on student math and reading scores and school demographics to highlight obvious trends in school performance. 

The final report includes: 


## District Summary

Using Pandas, a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics is created, including:

- Total Schools
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## School Summary

Using Pandas, an overview table is created that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

Pandas is used to create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. The table includes:

- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

Pandas is used to create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. All of the same metrics as listed above are included.


## Math Scores by Grade**

Pandas is used to create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


## Reading Scores by Grade

Pandas is used to create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


## Scores by School Spending

Pandas is used to create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Bins are created to group school spending. The following is included in the table:

- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## Scores by School Size

The above breakdown is repeated, but this time schooles are grouped based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).


## Scores by School Type

The above breakdown is repeated, but this time schools are grouped based on school type (Charter vs. District).
